            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they
                travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase
                your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives
                you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you
                determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and
                increase your lead generation.

<!-- Summary of what I changed to make this accessible

I added alt text for all images and icons

changed the unordered list section of links to the SEO, Online Rep Management and Social Media Marketing nav bar into a nav element

removed the class "header" due to the redundancy of the code

added <figure> around the images for html semantics, changed all <div> for the benefits section into <aside>, all <div> in the content section into <section> respectively

renamed sections hero-> background as it was the general formatting and background of the page
    content->content-format as it was formatting the blocks of content but had nothing to do with the actual content itself, could be misleading
    Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing -> content, as this was the actual content that we have in the section
        did the same to the benefits section
Added back the id's so that the nav bar could be functional, names remained the same as well
